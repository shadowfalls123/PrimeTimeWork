# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves rebranding the existing "ExamsAreFun" educational platform to use a new modern UI design called "PrimetimeUI". The current application is built with React, Material-UI, and Create React App, while the new design uses Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons. The rebranding should maintain all existing functionality while updating the visual design, user experience, and underlying UI framework.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Vite instead of Create React App for build tooling
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Tailwind CSS instead of Material-UI for styling
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Lucide React icons instead of Material-UI icons
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be modernized and well-structured, so that future maintenance and feature development is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all components SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript
2. WHEN building the application THEN the build process SHALL be faster and more efficient with Vite
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the component structure SHALL be modular and reusable
4. WHEN styling components THEN Tailwind CSS utility classes SHALL be used consistently
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the bundle size SHALL be optimized for better performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing features to continue working exactly as before, so that my workflow is not disrupted by the rebranding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in THEN the authentication system SHALL work identically to the current system
2. WHEN I take exams THEN all exam functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN I purchase packages THEN the payment system SHALL continue to work as expected
4. WHEN I navigate the application THEN all routes and navigation SHALL function identically
5. WHEN I use any feature THEN the business logic SHALL remain completely intact

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain excellent performance and accessibility, so that the user experience is optimal for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial load time SHALL be equal to or better than the current version
2. WHEN I use screen readers THEN all accessibility features SHALL be preserved or improved
3. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL remain accessible
4. WHEN the application runs THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized
5. WHEN I use the application on slow networks THEN performance SHALL be acceptable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the exam creation and management interfaces to have an improved user experience, so that creating and managing content is more efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create questions THEN the rich text editor SHALL have a modern, intuitive interface
2. WHEN I manage exams THEN the forms and controls SHALL be more user-friendly
